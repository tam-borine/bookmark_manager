## What is CRUD?

REPHRASE - The CRUD concept applies across many different relational database systems

REPHRASE - It is the most common language used to communicate with modern databases

The CRUD cycle - Create, Read, Update and Delete

The 4 basic functions of a persistent database (or persistent storage)

All of the major functions implemented in a relational database app

Each letter of CRUD maps to standard SQL and HTTP methods:

Create	INSERT	PUT / POST
Read (Retrieve)	SELECT	GET
Update (Modify)	UPDATE	POST / PUT / PATCH
Delete (Destroy)	DELETE	DELETE

Can also describe user interface conventions - e.g. viewing, searching and changing info

Data protection - Can lock data - prevents users access for deleting valuable data

Data life cycle - When data becomes obselete, it is deleted

Different users can have different CRUD cycles

Example 1:

Customer can create an account, retrieve it when going back to the website, update their billing info, or delete it if necessary.

Example 2:

An operations manager can create product records, call them when needed, change packaging/raw materials details, or delete if product becomes discontinued.

Users and administrators have privileges - to create, browse, edit or delete online records.


## What is SQL?

Structured Query language

SQL - a standard language for accessing databases/relational database systems

SQL commands - CREATE/INSERT/DROP/DELETE

Can use it to manipulate data in database systems such as PostgreSQL
